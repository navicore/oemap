oemap
=====

create a 'map' as a group of participants that can see each other on the map for predetermined lengths of time.  good for photowalks and hikes where you want certain people to be able to find you but don't want to have to remember to turn off your geo broadcasting.  you create a map, post the email to whoever you want to find you, a group, an individtual, etc.. and they can 'join' the map.

created to learn Android, mongodb, and nodejs better.  I still hope to add and IOS client and setup a new hosting environment.
