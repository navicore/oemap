<b>How does the Site use Personally Identifiable Information?</b><BR>

Your "Display Name" is shared with other users on the OeMap system who have joined the same sharable

have joined that map can see your information.

<b>What choices are available to Visitors regarding collection, use and distribution of the information?</b><BR>Using the software settings, a mobile software user may change the name displayed to other users without restriction.  That new name will be used and we will not store the real "Display Name" anywhere.
<BR>
<BR>
<b>Are Cookies Used on the Site?</b><BR> We use Cookies to enable the "not resharable" feature in the mobile software, ensuring only users you have allowed to join your map space may join your map space.
<BR>

There is no OeMap login!

<BR><b>Can a Visitor delete or deactivate Personally Identifiable Information collected by the Site?</b><BR> Yes, select the "Quit Map" menu option.
<BR>
<BR><b>What happens if the Privacy Policy Changes?</b><BR> We will let our Visitors and Authorized Customers know about changes to our privacy policy by posting such changes on the Site. However, if we are changing our privacy policy in a manner that might cause disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information that a Visitor or Authorized Customer has previously requested not be disclosed, we will announce to our mobile users with a software update push message to allow such Visitor or Authorized Customer to prevent such disclosure.
